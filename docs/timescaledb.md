## Database structure

All metrics are stored in a single table `ecoflow_metrics`. The structure of the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE if not exists ecoflow_metrics
(
    timestamp     TIMESTAMPTZ default NOW(),
    serial_number VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    metrics       JSONB   NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (timestamp, serial_number)
);

SELECT create_hypertable('ecoflow_metrics', 'timestamp', if_not_exists => TRUE);
```

The metric values are stored in one JSONB column `metrics`. It's a key/value map: "metric1" : "value1", "metric2" : "
value2".
One row in the table stores all metrics for given device for given timestamp.
You can easily get the metric name using jsonb operator: `cast(metrics ->> 'METRIC_NAME' AS float)`.
You can find usage examples below in this document.

There is no cleanup procedure implemented at the moment, so you might want to cleanup all records by yourself.

## How to run the TimescaleDB, Exporter and Grafana using docker-compose

1. Go to docker-compose folder: `cd docker-compose`
2. Update `.env` file with two mandatory parameters:
    - `ECOFLOW_ACCESS_KEY` - the access key from the Ecoflow development website
    - `ECOFLOW_SECRET_KEY` - the secret key from the Ecoflow development website
    - `TIMESCALE_ENABLED` - enable integration with TimescaleDB
3. (OPTIONALLY) Update other variables if you need to:
    - `TIMESCALE_USERNAME` - TimescaleDB username. Default value: `postgres`
    - `TIMESCALE_PASSWORD` - TimescaleDB password. Default value: `postgres`
    - `TIMESCALE_URL` - TimescaleDB connection string. The username and password should match the values
      from `TIMESCALE_USERNAME` and `TIMESCALE_PASSWORD`. Default
      value: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@timescaledb:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable`
    - `METRIC_PREFIX`: the prefix that will be added to all metrics. Default value is `ecoflow`. For instance
      metric `bms_bmsStatus.minCellTemp` will be exported to prometheus as `ecoflow.bms_bmsStatus.minCellTemp`.
    - `SCRAPING_INTERVAL` - scrapping interval in seconds. How often should the exporter execute requests to Ecoflow
      Rest API in order to get the data. Default value is 30 seconds.
    - `DEBUG_ENABLED` - enable debug log messages. Default value is "false". To enable use values `true` or `1`
    - `GRAFANA_USERNAME` - admin username in Grafana. Default value: `grafana`. Can be changed later in Grafana UI
    - `GRAFANA_PASSWORD` - admin password in Grafana. Default value: `grafana`. Can be changed later in Grafana UI

4. Save `.env` file with your changes.
5. Start timescaledb container: `docker-compose -f docker-compose/timescale-compose.yml up -d`
6. Start the exporter and
   grafana: `docker-compose -f docker-compose/grafana-compose.yml -f docker-compose/exporter-remote-compose.yml up -d`
7. The services are available here:
    - http://localhost:3000 - Grafana
    - TimescaleDB is available at the value of `TIMESCALE_URL` variable
8. Configure a new TimescaleDB datasource in Grafana according to example below:
   ![timescaledb-datasource.png](images/timescaledb-datasource.png)
9. Create your dashboard (TODO: add example of a dashboard)

## Tips how to fetch data from TimescaleDB

1. To fetch one metric you can use query like this:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp)                        as time,
       cast(metrics ->> 'ecoflow_inv_input_watts' as float) AS "Input Watts"
FROM ecoflow_metrics
where $__timeFilter(timestamp)
and serial_number = '$device'
```

Prometheus equivalent is: `ecoflow_inv_input_watts{device="$device"}`

2. To fetch one value ("current" metric value) use the query:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp)                        AS time,
       cast(metrics ->> 'ecoflow_pd_watts_in_sum' as float) as value
FROM ecoflow_metrics
where serial_number = '$device'
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Prometheus equivalent is: `ecoflow_pd_watts_in_sum{device="$device"}`

3. You can check how long you had a power outage and how long you got grid power on using the query:

```sql
WITH PowerEvents AS (SELECT timestamp,
                            CASE
                                WHEN cast(metrics ->> 'ecoflow_inv_ac_in_vol' AS float) = 0 THEN 'Power Off'
                                ELSE 'Power On'
                                END AS power_status,
                            serial_number
                     FROM ecoflow_metrics
                     WHERE serial_number = '$device'
                       and $__timeFilter(timestamp)),
     FilteredEvents AS (SELECT timestamp,
                               power_status,
                               LAG(power_status) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_power_status
                        FROM PowerEvents),
     ChangedEvents AS (SELECT timestamp,
                              power_status
                       FROM FilteredEvents
                       WHERE power_status IS DISTINCT FROM prev_power_status),
     NextEvents AS (SELECT timestamp                                 AS event_time,
                           power_status,
                           LEAD(timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_event_time
                    FROM ChangedEvents)
SELECT event_time   as "Event Time",
       power_status as "Power Status",
       round(COALESCE(
                     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (next_event_time - event_time)) / 60,
                     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - event_time)) / 60
             ), 0)  AS "Duration Minutes"
FROM NextEvents
ORDER BY event_time DESC;
```
